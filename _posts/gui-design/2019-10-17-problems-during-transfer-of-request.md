In systems where a lot of people work on different parallel projects we usually
can't be completely sure if we will break some existing functionality during
transfer of some request. It can be quite scary to transfer something in this
environment, but actually there is an easy way to check **before** the transfer.

You can follow these steps to do it:

1. Open transaction `/SDF/TRCHECK` _Check transport request_.
2. Optionally provide _RFC to Source System_. You can skip this step if you are
   currently logged in to the source system.
3. Provide _RFC to Target System_. Here you should choose RFC connection to a
   system to which you plan to perform corresponding transfer. If you are
   checking if there will be problems during transfer to Acceptance environment,
   provide RFC connection, that corresponds to Acceptance environment system.
   E.g. `ECATT_AS4CLNT200` for system `AS4`. Use search help (_F4_) to select
   the correct value.
4. Provide _Transport Requests_ (you can provide multiple at the same time).
   Alternatively, you could select _Import queue..._ if you are interested in
   **all** the requests from your import queue.
5. Set all transport checks that you want to be performed. I usually select all
   the checks:
    - cross reference;
    - sequence check;
    - cross release;
    - import time in source system;
    - online import check.
6. Press _Execute_ (_F8_).
7. You will most likely be asked to login (2 times) to the target system. Do
   that to initiate the checks.
8. Checks can take some time, especially if you chose multiple requests.
9. Results will be displayed in tabs (1 for each check selected). If the check
   is successful, you will see a green mark in the tab title. E.g. `(âœ“) Online
   Import Check`.
    - Red exclamation point will indicate that there are problems to be solved
      before the transfer. Usually you ask a developer to check what is the
      problem and how to solve it. E.g. `[!] Cross Reference`
    - Yellow exclamation point will indicate that there are some warnings to be
      checked. Usually they. E.g. `<!> Sequence Check`.

The most common source of problems will be on the tab _Cross Reference_. Some of
the objects you have in your requests were previously updated by another
transport request and this another request is not yet transferred to the target
system. Correct way to solve this is usually first to transfer the missing
transport, but it isn't always possible. If it is not possible, a developer is
usually needed either to put connected objects to a new request (e.g. data
types) or to remove conflicting changes from the object you plan to transfer.
